ABSTRACT 

     MODFLOW-NWT is a Newton formulation for MODFLOW-2005. MODFLOW-NWT is a 
standalone program that is intended for solving problems involving drying and 
rewetting nonlinearities of the unconfined groundwater-flow equation. MODFLOW-NWT
must be used with the Upstream-Weighting (UPW) Package for calculating intercell
conductances in a different manner than is done in the Block-Centered Flow (BCF), 
Layer Property Flow (LPF), or Hydrogeologic-Unit Flow (HUF) Packages. The UPW 
Package treats nonlinearities of cell drying and rewetting by use of a continuous 
function of groundwater head, rather than the discrete approach of drying and 
rewetting that is used by the BCF, LPF, and HUF Packages. This further enables 
application of the Newton formulation for unconfined groundwater-flow problems 
because conductance derivatives required by the Newton method are smooth over 
the full range of head for a model cell. The NWT linearization approach 
generates an asymmetric matrix, which is different from the standard MODFLOW 
formulation that generates a symmetric matrix. Because all linear solvers 
presently available for use with MODFLOW-2005 solve only symmetric matrices, 
MODFLOW-NWT includes two previously developed asymmetric matrix-solver options. 
The matrix-solver options include a generalized-minimum-residual (GMRES) Solver 
and an Orthomin / stabilized conjugate-gradient (CGSTAB) Solver. Flow-property 
input for the UPW Package is designed based on the LPF Package and material-
property input is identical to that for the LPF Package except that the rewetting
and vertical-conductance correction options of the LPF Package are not available
with the UPW Package. Input files constructed for the LPF Package can be used 
with slight modification as input for the UPW Package. MODFLOW-NWT is described
in the documentation report by Niswonger and others (2011).

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

     MODFLOW-NWT is written in Fortran 90 programming language. The code has 
     been used on personal computers running various forms of the Microsoft
     Windows operating system.


FUNTIONALITY

     MODFLOW-NWT can be run using the Newton linearization (NWT Package) and the 
     Upstream-Weighting (UPW) Package or it can be run using the standard 
     MODFLOW-2005 Picard linearization method (Harbaugh, 2005). Thus, some 
     MODFLOW-2005 Packages are supported by MODFLOW-NWT only when using the Picard
     linearization method of MODFLOW-2005. This version of MODFLOW-NWT includes
     the following MODFLOW-2005 packages:
